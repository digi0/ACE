# AI Academic Advisor (ACE)

ACE is a lightweight prototype of an AI-powered academic advising assistant that helps students explore course plans and navigate degree requirements through a conversational interface.

## What it does
- Guides users through course planning questions (requirements, prerequisites, sequencing)
- Produces structured recommendations (next courses, alternatives, constraints)
- Focuses on clear, student-friendly explanations and step-by-step guidance

## Tech / Approach
- Rapid prototyping using an AI app builder (Emergent) to validate UX and conversation flows
- Emphasis on prompt design, response structure, and iterative testing
- Next step: migrate core logic to a custom backend for stronger control, evaluation, and scalability

## Status
Actively iterating on recommendation flows and improving reliability with more structured prompts and test cases.

## Demo
If you have a demo link, put it here.  
(If not, write: “Demo available upon request.”)

## Roadmap
- Add structured course/degree rule data (JSON)
- Add evaluation tests for response consistency
- Build a simple React UI + API layer
